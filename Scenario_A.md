Hello John,

We regret to inform you that we cannot put you into the Advanced Track of the Interview Prep Program. Your score in your pre-work requirement only qualifies you to the **Intermediate Track**.

As part of our [application process](https://apply.codepath.org/cohorts/interview-prep-summer-2021/versions/student/), we calibrate every applicant's technical interview readiness level and place them into the best-fit group for their current experience. We understand that many want to be in the Advanced Track because of the highlighted topics, but to properly train and support every participant, we have to adhere to our process.

**We assure you that the Intermediate Track will work well for you.** We will group you with other students with similar experience level.

Please take note of the following **schedules for the Intermediate Track**:
- Program begins: **June 1, 2021**
- Day and Time: **Tue 6PM-8PM PT and Sat 10AM-12PM PT (Mandatory Attendance)**
- Duration: **12 weeks**

We look forward to being with you in this program. For questions, please email us at admissions@codepath.org.

<br>
All the best,
<br>
CodePath.org Team
