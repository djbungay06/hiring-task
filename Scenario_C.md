Hello Anne,

We like to extend our appreciation for reaching out and your interest in our Summer Interview Prep Course. In CodePath, we desire to help as many students as we can become competent software engineer professionals by providing various courses and training.

However, we regret to inform you that the said class is already full, and registration is already closed. We have received thousands of applications for the course, but we have to limit the number of participants to achieve our desired goal effectively and excellently.

We understand the difficulty of applying for an internship program especially, for graduate students like you. We want to help you by sharing our [high-level interview guide](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/HJN9k17sm?type=view) that contains tips and guidelines that applicants might find helpful.

You can also go to our [resources page](https://books.codepath.org/student-handbook/) where you can learn more about it. We'd also like to connect with you and notify you in case there are future courses or virtual events that you might be interested in by signing up for our [mailing list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst).

We wish you all the best in your current journey and hope you find a suitable internship program for you.

<br>
All the best,
<br>
CodePath.org Team
