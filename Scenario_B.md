Hello Jane,

Thank you for expressing your interest to learn from one of our programs. Unfortunately, for this moment, our courses are restricted to students enrolled in our partner universities within the United States. This is based on the current partnerships we receive as a non-profit organization that is why we have sections for eligibility checks on the front of all our applications.

We know how tedious it is to complete the application process, and we are sure that you are a promising student. We want to help you improve your skills by sharing the resources we have compiled from various sources. We have many [online resources for learning Android](https://support.codepath.com/knowledge_base/topics/how-can-i-get-started-learning-android-development-online) that includes an extensive list of [Android resources online](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Beginning-Android-Resources#beginning-android-resources).

Currently, CodePath runs classes in Haiti and also used to run some in Taiwan. We ambition to expand our program and training capacity to other nations in the future.

If you sign up for our [mailing list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst), we will connect with you and notify you as classes become available in your area powered by local organizers or through remote means.

We look forward to bring our programs to your country soon and expand our audience for future programs. Thank you for understanding.

All the best,
<br>
CodeaPath.org Team
