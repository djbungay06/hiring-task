Hello Dennis,

We regret to inform you that your withdrawal from the SE103 (Advanced Software Engineering) course due to non-compliance with our [course policy](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/ios_university/policies_remote_fall19) is **final**.

As you know, complete and on-time assignment submission is core to our educational model. We believe that success in the industry goes beyond proficiency in technical domains; **the ability to be punctual, meet project deadlines and work effectively in a collaborative team are equally important skills**. We only allow two late submissions, and even one missed assignment will result in removal from the course.

*Last May 25*, we sent you an email asking why you have not submitted the coursework, but we received **no response** coming from you.

Despite being removed from the class, you still have **lifetime access to the course material** provided that you will use the Github you used to sign up for us.

We will also notify you about our future courses and training that might interest you if you sign up for our [mailing list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst).

<br>
All the best,
<br>
CodePath.org Team
